The ROS-Industrial Consortium organizes cooperative projects between its members to develop new and advanced manufacturing technologies that benefit all participating partners. There are two different types of projects that are organised by the ROS-Industrial Consortium. 

## Focussed Technical Projects (FTP)
In a focussed technical project, the partners will focus on the development of a specific solution for manufacturing problems.


## Strategic Research Projects (SRP)
In a strategic research project, the partners will focus on researching new manufacturing and robotic processes and capabilities.

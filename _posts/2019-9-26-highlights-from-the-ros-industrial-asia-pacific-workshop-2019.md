The ROS-Industrial Consortium Asia Pacific recently held the annual workshop on the 18th to the 19th of June at the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) in Singapore. The theme for this year's workshop was "***The journey to ROS 2.0 and accelerating industry adoption***".

It was open to business leaders, developers and researchers, and this year spurred interest from over 110 attendees across 25 countries! The highlights video below gives a brief overview of what went down!

The event started off with an overview and update from the ROS-Industrial Asia Pacific Consortium. The updates mainly emphasized on the presence and impact of the consortium rapidly growing within the region. This also included the highlights from the events in the past year such as the Annual Workshop for 2018, ROSCON Japan 2018 and the Singapore International Robo Expo (SIRE). Later in the second day of the workshop, there was also a roadmapping exercise conducted by the ROS-Industrial team to help identify issues faced by end users and consolidate feedback on the transition of ROS 1 to ROS 2.0.

It was indeed our pleasure to host 17 speakers who presented on various exciting topics ranging from ROS 2.0 features and adoption, ROS in MATLAB and Windows, new Gazebo features, various application features as well as business trends for ROS and many more across the 2-day event.

Apart from presentations, the workshop also included exhibitions and live demonstrations of many different robotic applications which uses ROS, such as pallet detection, object detection and grasping, cleaning robots and more. The Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre also organized group tours around the labs within the facility including the Model Factory, Virtual Manufacturing Lab and the Manufacturing Intelligent Control Room.

We also had the opportunity to introduce the new members in the Asia-Pacific Consortium in person and presented their representatives with a token of appreciation.

The event was then wrapped up with a networking dinner which opened many opportunities for attendees to expand their network and to get to know other participants better. 

Industry members and attendees expressed a lot of interest in adopting upcoming ROS 2.0 into their products moving forward. With this positive progression, the ROS-Industrial Consortium Asia Pacific will continue to support its members in cultivating ROS into the industry of tomorrow.

With this being said, the ROS-Industrial team expresses our big thank you to everyone who attended the event, and we hope to see you next year!

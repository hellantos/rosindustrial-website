Southwest Research Institute is providing video editing services to create two separate video montages celebrating the anniversary of two respective ROS-based open source projects. Please visit the [video submission page](/video-submission) to upload your video for one of the following montages:

* ROS-Industrial (i.e. factory or manufacturing applications of ROS)
* MoveIt! (i.e. motion planning examples regardless of application/market)

**Deadline:** 28 March, 2017

Some guidelines for all video submissions:

* No cost for submission
* You will receive a link to upload upon submission of the form below
* Please name your files like this: John\_Doe\_Company\_Name\_1.mp4, John\_Doe\_Company\_Name\_2.mp4, etc.
* Any number of clips can be uploaded per person/organization
* Videos must be full HD quality or better to be used
* Portable device video must have adequate lighting and stabilization
* We prefer raw video that is not covered with text. borders, etc.
* We request that something interesting happens in 5 seconds or less, otherwise we reserve the right to accelerate the frame rate
* We interpret this submission as your consent to use your clip for this singular purpose. We will contact you if other use cases are desired.
* Don't forget to provide attribution/credit for all parties/collaborators involved in creating your video
* Use abbreviations for attributions/credits when possible to avoid line wrap
* If we are blessed to receive more submissions than we can fit in a short 2-3 min video, we will use the following criteria to select from among the available clips:
* Video quality (stable, in-focus, well-lit)
* Hardware diversity (robot/sensor brand variation among the ensemble of clips)
* Originality
* Professionalism (less duct tape, higher TRL)

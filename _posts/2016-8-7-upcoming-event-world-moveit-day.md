Join us August 23rd, 2016 for an international hackathon to improve the MoveIt! code base, documentation, and community. Following the heels of the repo merge, we hope to fix all broken links in the documentation, close as many longstanding pull requests and issues as possible, and have some fun with a newly released integrated simulation of MoveIt! manipulation + Gazebo + Fetch for us to test. An hour long Q&A session is scheduled at 9am Pacific to allow the community to meet the people merging their pull requests.

We will be having several event locations including:

* ROS Industrial at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Contact: Paul Hvass
* Fetch Robotics in San Jose, California. Contact: Michael Ferguson
* Xamla Robotics Team at Provisio GmbH in Münster, Germany. Contact: Andreas Köpf
* JSK at the University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan. Contact: Kei Okada

If you aren't near an organized event we encourage you to have your own event in your lab/organization/company and video conference in to all the other events. We would also like to mail your team or event some MoveIt! stickers to schwag out your robots with.

For more details, see the [event page](http://moveit.ros.org/events/world-moveit-day/).

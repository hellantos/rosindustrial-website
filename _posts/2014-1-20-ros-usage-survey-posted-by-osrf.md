ROS-Industrial builds on ROS, extending it to factory automation applications. The ROS core and web site are maintained by the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF), which also organizes the annual ROSCon event. OSRF support is a critical to the growth of the ROS community.

You have an opportunity to help OSRF and the ROS community: OSRF has created a [blog post](http://www.ros.org/news/2014/01/ros-usage-survey.html) requesting that we fill out a ROS Usage Survey for them. Please take a few moments to respond to the survey. Thanks!

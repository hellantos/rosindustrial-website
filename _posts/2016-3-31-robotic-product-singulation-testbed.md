We are excited to post our [50th ROS-I video](http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/video#preview): *Robotic Product Singulation Testbed.* This project was demonstrated during the [Annual Meeting](http://rosindustrial.org/news/2016/3/10/ar7j7d7bq9h9vcbndj6tzr7ybn072z) and is a collaborative development between ABB and SwRI to create a commercial product for warehouse automation. It highlights that, with some optimization, ROS-I applications can exhibit fast cycle times, without sacrificing the intelligence afforded by ROS. A scale demonstration of this technology will be on display next week at MODEX 2016, [booth MA 957 (Baldor/ABB)](http://www.modexshow.com/listing.aspx?ref=attendees&id=39961).

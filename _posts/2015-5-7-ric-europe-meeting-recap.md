Thanks to all the participants who attended our annual meeting on April 28! A number of member institution representatives gathered in Milan, Italy, to review last year's activities and discuss current and future initiatives. The ROS-I Consortium Europe is preparing to launch joint efforts in a number of areas ranging from simulation improvements to support for video compression, so consider [joining us](http://ric-eu.rosindustrial.org/consortium/join-now/) in order to achieve faster development results through our [FTP mechanism](http://rosindustrial.org/ric/about-ftps/). Learn more about RIC-EU's activities during the upcoming [2015 ROS-Industrial Conference](http://www.ipa.fraunhofer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Veranstaltungen/2015/2015_06_09_ROS-Industrial.pdf) which will take place June 9, 2015, on Fraunhofer's premises in Stuttgart, Germany.

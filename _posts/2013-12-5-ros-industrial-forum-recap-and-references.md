We appreciated the participation from the approximately 70 people who attended the ROS-Industrial Forum web event today, Dec. 5th. We are grateful to the presenters from Alten Mechatronics, Canada's NRC, CAT, TU Delft, Fraunhofer IPA, GA Tech, LANL, SwRI, and Yaskawa Motoman who provided the community with updates on progress and called for additional ROS-Industrial capabilities.

The event was recorded and can be replayed by going to this [link](http://youtu.be/wwE5OQsy0X8). The slides are also available upon [request](http://rosindustrial.org/contact-us/).

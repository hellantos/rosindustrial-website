As if in celebration of our one-year anniversary, ROS-I showcased it's capabilities at the Automate 2013 conference/exposition in Chicago last week. Check out the picture below.

We had a great spot at the front of the expo floor,and over the course of the show, hundreds of people stopped by to satisfy their curiosity about ROS-I. The main attraction was the ROS-I Interoperability Demo which consisted of a work cell enclosed by plexiglass which contained two robot arms: one Yaskawa Motoman SIA20d and one Universal Robots UR5. The robots collaborated to sort a cluttered pile of objects. The process involved one robot (the UR) singulating a part from a cluttered pile of parts,recognizing the part from 3D data, and the second robot (the Motoman) placing the part in a designated zone according to the classification of the part. Once all parts from the cluttered area were sorted, the process was reversed, with one robot passing parts back to the other robot, which placed the part on a ramp. The parts slid down the ramp and piled up randomly at the bottom, which was intended to show that the parts were not pre-positioned in the clutter. This showcased the on-the-fly path planning which was based entirely on the vision system (two PrimeSense camera's). Every grasp was planned based on camera sensor data. Each robot was aware of every object in its environment prior to moving to pick or place a part. The ultimate goal was to promote ROS-Industrial, which leverage's the open-source benefits of ROS, such as utilizing cutting-edge university research, and enabling communication to multiple robot types, in order to solve complex real-world problems.

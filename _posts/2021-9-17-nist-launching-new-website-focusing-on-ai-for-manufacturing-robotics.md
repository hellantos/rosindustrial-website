In a recent meeting with ROS-I Consortium Americas member and long time supporter of open source for industry, NIST's Craig Schlenoff noted some recent developments over at NIST and has provided the below to notify the borader ROS-I Community. Thanks to NIST for continuing to keep robotics, AI, and standards that seek to bring order to the space front and center!

Dear Robotics Enthusiasts,

NIST is pleased to announce the launch of a new community hub for research on AI for Manufacturing Robotics.
Link: <https://sites.google.com/view/ai4manufacturingrobotics/>

On this site you'll find several resources you may find of interest, including:

* Curated lists of relevant datasets, papers, and software repositories
* Learning resources on AI, Robotics, and the Manufacturing Industry
* Community content such as our on-going Research Spotlight article series
* Announcements/archives of workshops, conferences and more.

Please be sure to bookmark the site and join our slack at <https://tinyurl.com/ai-mnfg-robotics> if you found it helpful, since new material is being added regularly.

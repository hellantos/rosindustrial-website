Check out the exciting [schedule](http://rosindustrial.org/events/2016/11/3/2016-ros-industrial-conference) for the upcoming ROS-Industrial Training and Conference 2016, to be held Nov 2-4 at Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart, Germany. For this year's edition of the Conference we have the pleasure to host two keynote speakers. During the first day [Brian Gerkey](http://www.osrfoundation.org/team/brian-gerkey/), CEO and founder of the Open Source Robotics Foundation, will recap the history of ROS and share with the audience how advanced robotics is performed during "the era of open-source software". During the second day [Prof. Michael Beetz](http://ai.uni-bremen.de/team/michael_beetz) from the University of Bremen will illustrate how knowledge-based services such as [openEASE](http://www.open-ease.org/) can improve interoperability in robotics and lower the barriers for robot programming.
The training session has been updated as well, with our colleagues at [FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de/fachbereiche/maschinenbau-und-mechatronik/international/ros/) delivering a full day of hands-on ROS training, and ROS-Industrial Consortium Europe members [PPM AS](https://www.ppm.no/ppm-Home) and [IT+Robotics srl](http://www.it-robotics.it/?lang=en) providing FlexGui and cROS training during the second day.
Please note that there is a significant discount if you ~~register~~ (registration now closed) for both events, and a further reduction for ROS-Industrial Consortium members. See you in Stuttgart on November 2-4!

I had the opportunity to attend CRAV.ai 2019 in San Jose CA and
present SwRI's work on collaborative robots; this work described how we built a
sophisticated collaborative robotics application where various tasks were taught
to a robot arm by way of human demonstration. One highlight of this application
is that it leveraged low-cost sensors and open-source software frameworks such
as ROS, MoveIt, AruCo, Ceres, etc.

The presentation was very well received, and we hope it'll lead to opportunities
to further that work and continue to do research in that space.

Furthermore, there were a great deal of interesting presentations that explored
innovative ways to make robots collaborate and empower human workers in the
various industries where the inherent adaptability and dexterity of humans
remains irreplaceable.

Human Augmentation of Robots for the Automation Age (SARCOS):

* Described the following challenges in manufacturing:
* Projected labor shortages in the US and many other industrialized nations in
the next decade will have a negative impact on the economy in the trillions
of dollars.
* Occupational injuries incur an annual cost of \$100 billion in the US
* Complete automation isn't the solution to the labor shortage challenges
ahead

	+ Humans will continue to play a role in manufacturing due to the
	unstructured and unpredictable nature of very many tasks for which
	automation falls off short.
	+ SARCOS showed its GUARDIAN XO powered exoskeleton which a human can
	operate in unstructured environments in order to carry out a diverse set
	of tasks.
	+ The suit provides the human worker with added strength and endurance,
	reduces the risk of injuries and enhances productivity.

How Robot Motion Planning is setting Robots Free (Collaborative Robotics):

* Interesting approach to multi robot motion planning using precomputed swept
volumes

How AI, Robotics, Vision, and Industry 4.0 Will Revolutionize manufacturing
(Canon USA)

* Great summary of past technological revolutions

	+ Mechanization, steam power, weaving loom (Industry 1.0)
	+ Mass production, assembly line, electrical energy (Industry 2.0)
	+ Automation, computers, electronics (Industry 3.0)
* Industry 4.0 forecast

	+ Increased efficiency through robot/human collaboration
	+ The concept of the Smart Factory (highly digitized and interconnected
	production)
	+ Large scale data anaylysis
* Lights Out Manufacturing

	+ Advanced sensing technologies that allows robots and machines to operate
	in the dark
	+ If implemented correctly could maximize efficiency and profitability.
	+ Not a common approach in factories but its viable given current
	technologies.
* The Role of AI

	+ Predictive maintenance would eliminate the need for predetermined
	schedules
	+ Through machine learning and data collection, systems could adapt to
	changes or function with fewer interruptions
	+ Increase the remaining useful life of machinery

Volumetric Technologies for Future Sports Experiences (Intel Sports)

* The role of advanced technologies in today's sports

	+ An array of cameras placed around the stadium allows creating a virtual
	camera view at any desired location
	+ Broadcast Enhancements allow creating a narrative or facilitate
	advertisement
	+ Automated virtual camera movement allows following players, follow ball,
	predict best camera position, etc.
	+ Used by various professional tournaments and leagues
* Volumetric video

	+ Can create rich, compelling and immersive media experience.
	+ Combined with VR headsets would provide a fundamentally new way to
	experience sports

It was a pleasure to be part of such an interesting event, and we look forward
to both contributing and working with others to advance robotics, in particular
where collaboration is a key element.

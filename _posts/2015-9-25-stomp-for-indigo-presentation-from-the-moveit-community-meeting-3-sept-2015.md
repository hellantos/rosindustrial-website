We are grateful to Sachin Chitta for hosting the inaugural MoveIt! community meeting on September 3, 2015. During the meeting, Jorge Nicho, an SwRI ROS-Industrial team member, presented his work updating the Stochastic Trajectory OptiMization Planner (STOMP) for use in the Indigo release of MoveIt! (refer to the video below). STOMP is particularly useful for generating well behaved smooth collision-free motion plans in reasonable time.

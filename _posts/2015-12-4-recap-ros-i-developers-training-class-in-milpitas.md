In collaboration with E&M, Flex, SVR, Olympus Controls, and SwRI, the ROS-Industrial Fall training class gave participants an opportunity to learn new skills through hands-on experience. The ROS-Industrial Basic Developers Training Class was held November 16 -18, 2015, in Milpitas, CA at [Flex](https://www.flextronics.com/). The event included a tour of the Flex AEG Labs, specifically the areas of Wearables Tech, Failure Analysis - Reliability Testing and Automation Development. 

On November 16 the class reviewed ROS packages, parameters, topics, messages, launch files and URDF's. The next day of training took developers through foundational robot manipulation (with an introduction to the Descartes path planner) and perception. The last day of training consisted of a multi-option lab day. The training curriculum for each session can be found [here](http://aeswiki.datasys.swri.edu/rositraining/indigo/Exercises). We had participants from 3M, Bastian Solutions, Flex, Foresight Robotics US, Modbot, Olympus Controls, Siemens, and Stratasys. Check out pictures from the class below.

Special thanks to:

* **Flex** for their help in coordinating the tour, arranging the training location(s), and overall support of the ROS-I training. Special thanks goes out to Hassan Aluraibi and Alexandra Coltman for their roles in leading the coordination effort.
* **E&M** for providing lunch on Nov. 17.
* **Silicon Valley Robotics** for helping to promote the class.
* **Olympus Controls** for providing two UR robots to use during the lab day.

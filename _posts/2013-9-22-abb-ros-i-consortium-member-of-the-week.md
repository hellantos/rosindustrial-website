We are planning to post a highlight of each ROS-I Consortium Americas member explaining a little more about there role in the robotics community and their interest in ROS-Industrial. We begin this week with ABB.

ABB Corporate Research Center, USA
----------------------------------

ABB Robotics is a leading supplier of industrial robots, modular manufacturing systems and integration services. They provide a comprehensive range of robots to help manufacturers improve productivity, product quality and worker safety. The IRB 2400 and 5400 were the first two ABB robots to be integrated with ROS-Industrial. A ROS-I enabled IRB 2400 was recently used to develop the MTConnect Bridge in collaboration with NIST (more about MTConnect in a future post).

ABB
is excited to join and have stated: "*ABB Robotics' future success depends on
understanding emerging trends, including new methods of programming robots and
industrial automation equipment. To maintain an innovative edge, our products
should be able to interface with cutting edge programming platforms so that our
research and development teams and partners won't be limited in their
creativity or ability to solve challenges.*"

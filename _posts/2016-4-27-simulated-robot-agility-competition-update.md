This is a short update for those who have interest in participating in the [International Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition (ARIAC)](http://case2016.org/). Here are some things you should be aware of:

* We invite you to attend the [Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE](http://case2016.org/)) (August 21-24), where we will have the official competition kickoff. All of the specific information about the conference will be presented at a full day workshop. We will have academic, industrial and government speakers the first part of the day. The second part of the day will be tutorials and training to give you the best jump start on learning the software and tools necessary for the competition.
* If you can't make our workshop, we are holding a live webinar so you can still take advantage of the talks, training, and tutorials.
* The actual competition is expected to be held in early 2017 in the cloud, so no travel is necessary.
* Winners will be showcased at CASE 2017

If you are interested in Speaking at our workshop there are still spots available. Speakers who make it to CASE, will have the option of being listed as cosponsors of the competition. If you would like to speak or be involved in some other way [please contact us](mailto:william.harrison@nist.gov).

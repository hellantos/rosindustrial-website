The ROS-Industrial Consortium Americas hosted a ROS-Industrial Developers Training Class February 13-15, 2017, at SwRI located in San Antonio, Texas. A diverse set of organizations including Air Force Research Lab, The Boeing Company, Caterpillar, National Research Council Canada, SwRI, The University of Texas at Austin, and Yaskawa America Inc. Motoman Robotics Division were represented by 17 attendees. The three-day class was geared toward individuals with a C++ programming background who sought to learn to compose their own ROS nodes.

* Day 1 focused on introductory ROS skills.
* Day 2, the class examined motion planning using MoveIt! as well as using the Descartes path planner.
* Day 3 included an introduction to perception and culminated with lab programming exercises (with a choice of): Pick-and-Place Application, Descartes Application.

Many thanks to Jeremy Zoss and Levi Armstrong who led the training class. Additional thanks to Austin Deric, Jonathan Meyer, and Geoffrey Chiou who updated the training curriculum to ROS Kinetic. The training curriculum is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_training/wiki).

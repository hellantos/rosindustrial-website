Five years after the very first [public event](http://www.ros.org/news/2012/09/11/ROSIndustrialWorkshop.pdf/Flyer_17-10-2012_eng.pdf) entirely devoted to discussing the potential benefits of a shared, open-source framework for industrial robotics and automation, Fraunhofer IPA will host the 2017 edition of the ROS-Industrial Conference in Stuttgart, Germany, on December 12 to 14. From its inception five years ago, the initiative went from proof of concepts developed by a few organizations envisioning to advance manufacturing through open source, to:

* a worldwide initiative, with three regional consortia financially backed by more than 50 organizations
* a growing collection of software packages, expanding the capabilities and the platform support of ROS
* a number of installations of ROS-powered equipment working in production within industrial environments

We are pleased to invite you to join us in Stuttgart to reflect on those past 5 years, gauge the current status of the initiative through tech talks and application examples, and hear from the experts about the next obstacles to overcome for open-source robotics. You are welcome to browse the
[updated schedule](http://rosindustrial.org/events/2017/12/12/ros-industrial-conference-2017) of the event, as well as to ~~preregister~~ (the event is sold out and the waiting list is full!)

The ROS-Industrial Basic Developers' Training Class curriculum was developed under funding from the ROS-Industrial Consortium to streamline the introduction of Ubuntu Linux, ROS, ROS-I, PCL, and MoveIt! to industrial automation C++ code developers who are new to ROS. The curriculum culminates with a vision-enabled pick-and-place project. The class was first developed for the ROS-Groovy version and held in [June 2013](http://rosindustrial.org/news/ros-i-training-class-photos). [In May 2014](http://rosindustrial.org/news/2014/5/23/ros-i-training-class-photos), we updated and extended the course for ROS-Hydro.

With the approval of the ROS-I Consortium Advisory Committee, the curriculum has been made public (Creative Commons license) and linked to the [ROS-I wiki](http://aeswiki.datasys.swri.edu/rositraining). The class materials consist of presentation slides, step-by-step instructions, and source code for exercises. Each of the exercises is intended to take approximately 30 minutes to complete. The source code is now available on the [ROS-I GitHub site](https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_training). Links:

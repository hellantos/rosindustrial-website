The Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific (ITAP) is the regional version of the iconic Hannover Messe, organized by Singex Exhibitions & Deutsche Messe. This event is one of the leading trade events in relation with Industry 4.0.

ITAP was aimed at bringing in key stakeholders and companies to encourage collaboration and deepen the understanding of advanced manufacturing and adoption of Industry 4.0 solutions.

ROS-Industrial Asia Pacific Consortium participated as an exhibitor this year, showcasing diverse demonstrations powered by the capabilities of ROS, and also featured with our consortium members ADLINK & Pepperl+Fuchs. The exhibition was stretched over a course of three days, from the 22nd to the 24th of October, 2019.

One of our teammates Bey Hao Yun had the opportunity to conduct a few sessions hands-on session over the three-day period, which aimed to demonstrate to the audience the simplicity of creating a robotics solution using off-the-shelf open source software modules. His presentation excellently illustrated the entire programming flow in the usage of ROS for such applications.

Our consortium manager, Erik Unemyr, had also conducted a sandbox presentation on *Accelerating Automation & Robotics Solutions with Open Source Software.*

It was great to see users of ROS as well as people who are interested in learning and adopting ROS solutions come forward with questions for us throughout the entire exhibition.

Spring training classes for ROS-Industrial gave participants an opportunity to learn new skills through hands-on training. The March class, "What Can I Do with ROS-I?", was a one-day high-level overview and experience with RViz, MoveIt!, PCL, and ROS-Industrial. The "ROS-Industrial Basic Developers' Training Class," held May 19-20, took developers through foundational robot manipulation and perception ROS-I/C++ coding skills leading to a collision-free pick-and-place capstone project. Included in the two classes, we had participants from ABB, Bell Helicopter, Boeing, CAT, Cessna, Cox Machine, Empire Robotics, ESCO, EWI, Ford, GA Tech, GE, IDEXX, John Deere, OmniCo AGV, OSRF, Rensselaer CATS, SER, Siemens, Tempo Automation, UTARI, UT Austin NRG, Wolf Robotics, Yaskawa Motoman. Check out pictures from the classes below.

On March 5, we had a number of demonstrations and presentations, and would like to thank:

* Mr. Chris Pennington of Olympus Controls for the UR5 robot used in the *Camera-to-Robot Calibration* demo
* Mr. Jack Thompson of UT NRG for the *Multiscale Teleoperation* demo
* Dr. Jake Huckaby of GA Tech Cognitive Robotics Lab for the presentations about:
	+ *A Skill Abstraction Framework in Robot Manufacturing Tasks*
	+ *OmniMapper: A Modular Multimodal Mapping Framework*
* Mr. Patrick Dingle of Empire Robotics for the *VERSABALL* demo
* Ms. Katherine Scott for her blog post about the class: [Industrial Grade Awesome!](http://www.kscottz.com/ros-industrial-industrial-grade-awesome/)

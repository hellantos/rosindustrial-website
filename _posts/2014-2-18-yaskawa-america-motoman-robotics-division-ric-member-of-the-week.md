What began as a collaboration between SwRI, Willow Garage, and Yaskawa America--Motoman Robotics, grew into ROS-Industrial (ROS-I). The first industrial manipulator to run an industrial robot client was a Motoman SIA 20D with DX100 controller, which would become the architecture for the driver layer in the ROS-I socket interface for manipulation. Since that first demonstration, Yaskawa has continued to support ROS-Industrial in a number of ways:

* Assisted in development of new Moto Plus modules for both the DX100 and FS100 controllers to enable both smooth and full speed manipulation via a socket interface:<http://wiki.ros.org/motoman>.
* Joined theROS-Industrial Consortium and presented "Why Industrial Robot OEMs Should Care about ROS" at our first [Consortium meeting](http://youtu.be/67HsYAN-VJA) and at [ROSCon 2013](http://vimeo.com/67044628).
* Supported a hardware demonstration of ROS-Industrial for a [deburring application](http://youtu.be/wt_cyo8si5g) at ROSCon 2013.

This early involvement and support for ROS-I has made Motoman hardware hardware easy to integrate, and has led to a number of demonstrations using their hardware:

* [Interoperability demo](http://youtu.be/wCUhnFSBUBE)
* [Mobile manipulation](http://youtu.be/K0Ol5vv8tsE)
* [Multi-scale teleoperation](http://youtu.be/ab_3ZWCvUyU)
* [Pick and place demo](http://youtu.be/_WG-45cZSUQ)

**Teaser:** Recently, Yaskawa has teamed with [RIC EU](http://ric-eu.rosindustrial.org/) leader Fraunhofer IPA to create a standard ROS-I interface for dual arm robots, based on guidance from a [ROS-I Enhancement Proposal](https://github.com/ros-industrial/rep/blob/master/rep-I0001.rst#motion-interface) posted by SwRI. We will provide updates as they become available.

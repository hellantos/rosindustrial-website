Spring training classes for ROS-Industrial gave participants an opportunity to learn new skills through hands-on training. The ROS-Industrial Developers' Training Class was held April 29 - May 2, 2015, in Peoria, Illinois in collaboration with Caterpillar Inc. The training started with a tour of a Caterpillar manufacturing plant where the participants were able to see the assembly of several types of Caterpillar tractors. 

For the first time, SwRI prepared an advanced track curriculum to go alongside the Basic Track ([full agenda](/s/RIC-Developers-Training-Program-and-Agenda.pdf)). On April 30 the class of 40 split into two groups; the basic track reviewed ROS packages, parameters, topics, messages, launch files and URDF's while the advanced track reviewed and implemented the Industrial Calibration Library and a snippet of OpenCV code. The rest of training took developers through foundational robot manipulation (with an introduction to the Descartes path planner) and perception leading to a multi-option lab day. The lessons for each session for both advanced and basic tracks can be found [here](http://aeswiki.datasys.swri.edu/rositraining/indigo/Exercises). We had participants from ABB, Alpha Automation, Boeing, CAT, GE, HDT Robotics, IDEXX, John Deere, Northwestern University, Siemens, UT Austin NRG, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Vetex, Vizient, and Wolf Robotics. Check out pictures from the classes below.

We would like to thank Caterpillar for their help in coordinating the tour, providing transportation, arranging the training location(s), and overall support of the ROS-I training. Special thanks goes out to Matt Robinson and John Sherman for their roles in leading the coordination effort. 

In addition, thanks to Jeremy Zoss, Chris Lewis and Jorge Nicho from SwRI for serving as knowledgeable and supportive instructors for this year's training.

The 2nd ROS-Industrial Community Forum webinar was held on April 28, hosted by Alexander Bubeck ofFraunhofer IPA. The featured topic of the forum was the new ROS/ROS-I interface to Comau robot controllers. That topic was covered in two presentations, first by Fabrizio Romanelli of Comau, and then also by Elisa Tosello from the University of Padua, Intelligent Autonomous Systems Lab.

Five-minute "Lightning Talks" were also given on various topics:

* Industrial Calibration (Chris Lewis, SwRI)
* A ROS Control overview and what it means for ROS-I (Adolfo Rodriguez Tsouroukdissian, PAL Robotics)
* Overview of the European Robotics Challenge, (Ramez Awad, Faunhofer IPA)
* Updates of recent developments on the BRIDE MDE toolchain, (Alexander Bubeck, Fraunhofer IPA)

ROS-Industrial Community Forums are open to the broad ROS-Industrial community and foster the dissemination of information about new ROS-Industrial capabilities and best practices. If you are interested in presenting at the next Forum, please [contact us](/contact-us).

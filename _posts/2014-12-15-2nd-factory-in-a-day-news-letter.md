We are happy to report that the [second Factory-in-a-Day newsletter](http://www.factory-in-a-day.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Newsletter-Factoryinaday_2-.pdf) is posted. Topics covered in this newsletter include:

* Letter from the project Coordinator, Dr. Martijn Wisse, TU Delft
* Workshop on Philips use case
* Spotlight on: Philips
* Do robots kill jobs?

The Factory-in-a-Day project leverages the [ROS-I repository](https://github.com/ros-industrial), and is supporting improvements and maintenance of the [Universal Robots package](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot). As new general factory automation capabilities are created through this project, we anticipate that they will be added to the ROS-I repository.

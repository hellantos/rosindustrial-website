Southwest Research Institute is hosting a ROS-Industrial Training Class April 6 – 8, 2016 in San Antonio Texas. 

The classroom portion is similar to the training held last year with the same curriculum and lab option for Descartes; a more detailed agenda can be found at the [ROS-I website](http://rosindustrial.org/events/2016/4/6/ros-i-developers-training-class). Please bring a laptop to the class with the ROS-I training [Virtual Machine pre-installed](http://aeswiki.datasys.swri.edu/rositraining/Indigo%20PC%20Setup). This class is geared toward individuals with a programming background who seek to learn to compose their own ROS nodes. Day 1 will focus on basic/introductory ROS concepts. Day 2 will examine motion planning using MoveIt! as well as the Descartes planner and Perception concepts. Day 3 offers a lab programming exercise (with a choice of):  
• Simple Perception Lab  
• Simple MoveIt! Application  
• Simple Descartes Application.  
• Pick and Place Application  
Registration is now open: <http://rosindustrial.org/training-registration>

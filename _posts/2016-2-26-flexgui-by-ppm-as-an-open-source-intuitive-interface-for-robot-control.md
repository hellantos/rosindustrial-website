Following the announcement made at [the last RIC-EU Members Meeting](http://rosindustrial.org/news/2016/2/5/ric-europe-event-recap-tech-demo-2016-members-meeting), [PPM AS](https://www.ppm.no/flexgui-Home) released a significant part of its [FlexGui](https://www.ppm.no/flexgui-Home) software package as open-source. FlexGui, which is now [part of the ROS-Industrial project](https://github.com/ros-industrial/flexgui_industrial), is an easy-to-configure interface originally developed for the control panel of Nachi robots. Its latest release runs on any browser-equipped device, including industrial PCs and tablets, making it also suitable for remote supervision. ROS-integration makes it now possible to control through FlexGui the wide range of platforms supported by ROS, and its factory designer functionality makes it appealing for production scenarios rich of sensors and other networked devices, such as those envisioned by the Industrie 4.0 initiative.

Another ROS-Industrial Developer Class took place on October 10th at the Caterpillar Visitor's Center in Peoria, IL. It consisted of a three-day program that provided basic and advanced track offerings.

Day 1's basic track covered several key ROS concepts such as messages, services, and nodes. At the end of each section students were given lab exercises allowing them to incrementally build a ROS application. The advanced track focused on building a perception pipeline from the ground up using the [Point Cloud Library](http://pointclouds.org/) to process 3D sensor data.

Day 2 delved into creating a robot model using URDF and Xacro files and doing intelligent motion planning using [MoveIt!](http://moveit.ros.org/) Furthermore, this class also included a section on process path planning using the [Descartes Planning Library](http://wiki.ros.org/descartes).

On Day 3, students were given three lab programming exercises where they had the opportunity to create applications that combined perception and robot motion-planning concepts covered in the course. Two UR5 robots were made available so students could run their completed ROS applications on real hardware.

The attendees were from various organizations, including Caterpillar, Boeing, ABB, IDEXX Laboratories, Magna, and Tormach. We extend our thanks to all of them for attending and for their positive feedback. The class curriculum can be found [here](https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_training/wiki).

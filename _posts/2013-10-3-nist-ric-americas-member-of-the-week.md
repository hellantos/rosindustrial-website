Founded in 1901 and now part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST) is one of the nation's oldest physical science laboratories. The Next-Generation Robotics and Automation Program within the Intelligent Systems Division at NIST has many areas of research focus that overlap with capabilities being developed in ROS-Industrial: Part Grasping and Assembly, Safety of Human-Robot Systems, Robot Perception for Identifying and Locating Parts for Assembly, Robot Perception for Workspace Situational Awareness.

For
NIST, consortia such as the RIC provide a key mechanism for engaging with
industry to carry out its mission and advance robot capabilities, particularly
for manufacturing applications, through consensus definition and understanding
of the requirements for advanced applications.

NIST has already leveraged ROS-Industrial for two projects â€“
An MTConnect and ROS-I Integrated Robotic Workcell and Human Tracking for automation
safety.[MTConnect](http://www.mtconnect.org/)is a standard interface for controllers of
machining equipment, such as CNC mills and lathes. ROS-Industrial provides a
unified software platform for industrial robots. The goal of this project was
to create a software layer that will provide a generic bridge between the
MTConnect and ROS-Industrial interface standards. A final demonstration
consisted of an industrial robot loading raw material into a simulated CNC
lathe and unloading finished product. For the second project, NIST is
evaluating a prototype sensor system for the purpose of detecting and tracking
humans in industrial environments. No standards exist for either measuring the
performance or certifying the applicability of perception technologies for
detecting and tracking people in such dynamic and unstructured environments.
Reliably detecting and tracking movements of nearby workers on the factory
floor is crucial to ensuring safety around ever more cooperative manufacturing
automation. Future blog posts will provide more detail about the MTConnect and
Human Tracker projects.

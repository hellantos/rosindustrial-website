The ROS-Industrial global community organized and pulled together the first
World ROS-I Day, inspired by the successes of World MoveIt! Day, but focusing on
the repositories relevant to ROS-I. We had five sites signed up to host, and we
meet up in virtual collaboration rooms as well. The event kicked off from Asia,
led by our friends at ARTC in Singapore, ROS-I Asia-Pacific, handing off to the
EU, hosted by Fraunhofer IPA, then finally to the Americas, hosted by SwRI's
ROS-I Team located at [LiftOff](https://liftoff.liftfund.com/), thanks to [PlusOne Robotics](https://plusonerobotics.com/), in San Antonio,
Texas.

The Asia-Pacific team was joined by a team based in Delhi, India, and the U.S.
team was also joined by the [Open Robotics](https://www.openrobotics.org/) team in Mountain View, California.
Though these were the meet ups that we were aware of, there were a number of
additional teams and individuals that contributed, and the ROS-I developing
teams have been happy to see the level of engagement, and hope we can maintain
this level of participation moving forward.

We were excited to get to work and do some clean up with the ROS-I teams on the
various repositories and packages, working on a predefined list of issues. The
ROS-I development teams started with a list of repositories as the focus of the
inaugural World ROS-I Day on July 11. This enabled for making of a manageable
scope and allowed for tracking of progress throughout the day.

The repositories included for the event were:

On the ros-industrial organisation:

* ros\_industrial\_issues
* industrial\_training
* industrial\_ci
* industrial\_moveit
* industrial\_core
* ros\_qtc\_plugin
* robotiq
* universal\_robot (except driver infrastructure)
* ros\_canopen

Also over at the ros-industrial-consortium organization:

* Descartes
* Descartes tutorials

The maintainers worked up reviewing the repositories and classifying the issues
and including them in [an issue board](https://github.com/orgs/ros-industrial/projects/2). This really enabled the organization and
workflow for the event. We had designated assigners for issues and leveraged an
IRC chat room to do assignment of issues and enable efficient communication for
remote teams. Within the rooms we had to be careful managing that we did not do
redundant work. Though a few times issues were worked by multiple developers,
for the most part, the event went off well considering the logistical challenges
that can be encountered when working across multiple time zones around the
world.

Over the 22 hours that World ROS-I Day was in-flight, 31 issues were closed and
there are, at this time, 16 Pull Requests to be reviewed, with a handful of
assigned issues still being worked, per the issue board.

Overall, the ROS-I team, and we hope all those that leverage ROS-Industrial
repositories, feel this was a worthwhile and a quite successful event. Traffic
statistics indicate that the repositories of interest saw sustained activity
even after World ROS-I Day.

Moving forward, we are working to continue the momentum. This will manifest
itself in an effort to improve the monthly ROS-I Developers' Meeting, which we
have been working to socialize via the ROS-I Discourse Category at
<https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros-i-developers-meeting/5047/18>. Furthermore, we
are excited to continue our support of [World MoveIt! Day](https://rosindustrial.org/events/2018/10/25/world-moveit-day-americas) this October. And, of course, we are excited to begin the planning for a
follow World ROS-I Day, and are looking forward to getting the feedback from the
developing community for how to make this event more meaningful and engaging.

It is an exciting time in open-source software as an interest is advancing in
industrial and manufacturing automation capability. We look forward to continue
engaging the development community and to provide avenues for collaboration.
ROS-I set out to be an open-source project to bring the power of ROS to
industrial applications. Along the way, it has at times, been difficult to bring
the developing community to these same applications. We hope through engagement
and meaningful collaboration events, we can build that community, and we hope
you look forward to laying those foundational pieces with us.

Keep an eye out for updates on planning/details for World MoveIt! Day, and of
course the second annual World ROS-I Day, potentially in the first quarter of
2019, but of course, we are open to timing recommendations. Thanks for your
continued interest in open-source for industrial automation!

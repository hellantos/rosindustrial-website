We were fortunate to have OSRF represented at the ROS-Industrial Asia Pacific Workshop, which was hosted by ARTC and NTU in Singapore this July. Thanks Brian and Morgan! If you haven't seen a recent presentation about ROS and the community of ROS users, Brian's presentation was for you (refer to video below).

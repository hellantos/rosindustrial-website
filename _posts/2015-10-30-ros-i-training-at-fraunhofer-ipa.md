At the 5th edition of the ROS-Industrial training workshop, held at Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart, Germany, attendees from both industry and academia were given a general introduction to the ROS concept, structure and tools, to then receive hands-on training on three separate sessions covering perception, manipulation, and navigation.

The workshop was followed by an overview of current activities of the ROS-Industrial Consortium Europe. We are happy about the feedback that we received, and as ROS(-Industrial) awareness and usage spreads, we are preparing for more in-depth training workshops to be delivered in 2016. You can find the dates of the next training sessions in the [calendar](http://rosindustrial.org/news/2015/10/10/upcoming-ros-i-events) of upcoming events.

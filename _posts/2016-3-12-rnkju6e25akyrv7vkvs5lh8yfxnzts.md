This Summer, ROS-Industrial will be participating in the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) under the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) umbrella.

GSoC is a great way for students to participate in open source projects and get paid. It's also a great opportunity to get some work done on an open source project and grow our community. ROS-Industrial has had several successful GSoC projects in the past and many of the students continue on as members of our community.

If you are an interested student, or know of one, please check out our idea page: <http://wiki.osrfoundation.org/gsoc16>. 

Students have until March 25, 2016, to submit proposals for these ideas to GSoC. More details on the timeline can be found here: <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline> . 

I encourage students who wish to participate to reach out ([swri-ros-pkg-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto://swri-ros-pkg-dev@googlegroups.com)) with any questions or ideas they might have about suggested projects. For GSoC rules, check out: <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/rules>

Looking forward to being overloaded with proposals...

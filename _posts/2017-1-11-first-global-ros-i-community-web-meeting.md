Thanks to our presenters, Dr. Conghui Liang (who also hosted), Georg Heppner, Dr. Suraj Nair, and Louise Poubel for an inspiring Global ROS-I Community Web Meeting on 10 January 2017! For details, scroll to abstracts and links below the video.

**Host:** Dr. Conghui Liang (Research Fellow), Robotics Research Center, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore
(representing ROS-Industrial Consortium Asia Pacific)

**Agenda:**

* Dr. Conghui Liang (NTU): An Introduction of [RADOE](http://www.singaporerobotics.org/wp8-radoe) (A*STAR Industrial Robotics Project) and ROS related projects in NTU ([video link](https://youtu.be/GdS0W0lBRmM))
	+ RADOE (Robot Application Development and Operating Environment) is developed based on ROS and ROS-Industrial. It is an incorporation of high-level robotic software and useful tools that have been developed in the A*STAR industrial robotics research program for diversified robotics application developments in the manufacturing sector. In this talk, an overview of the RADOE motivation, architecture design, function modules, and several application demos will be presented.
* Georg Heppner (FZI): ReApp Project â€“ MDE for ROS & Generic IO for FANUC Robots ([video link](https://youtu.be/nb5iPdNjvNU))
	+ [Reusable Software Apps for Robotic Applications (ReApp)](http://www.reapp-projekt.de/index.php?id=reapp_home) based on ROS-Industrial is nearing its completion. This presentation will give an introduction into its core ideas and tools for model-driven engineering of ROS packages with semantic support. Additionally, the implementation of the Generic I/O communication package which was used for a FANUC industrial robot in one of ReApps pilot demonstrators will be covered.
* Dr. Suraj Nair (TUM CREATE): Robotics at TUM CREATE, Singapore: Insight into ROS based Projects ([video link](https://youtu.be/UDYdwV0wfok))
	+ TUMCREATE, Singapore is a research outpost of the Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany. Although its main focus is on future mobility applied to public transportation, the robotics activities at TUMCREATE have been expanding rapidly. This presentation will focus on the various robotics activities at TUMCREATE with special emphasis on the [Aviation Challenge 2](http://www.tum-create.edu.sg/research/project/aviation-challenge-2) project. For each of the activities, the connection to ROS will also be presented.
* Louise Poubel (OSRF): [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) UX Test Drive ([video link](https://youtu.be/qOhfEweo7V8))
	+ Gazebo is one of the most used simulators in the ROS community. It has been under heavy development for the past few years and its most recent version, Gazebo 7, comes with several new tools and features for new and experienced users alike. Updates include not only improved GUI tools and documentation for new users, but also tools that streamline the workflow for experienced users. In this presentation, many of these new features will be demonstrated from within Gazebo.

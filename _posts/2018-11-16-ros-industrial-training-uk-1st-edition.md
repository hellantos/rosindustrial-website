The first UK edition of the ROS-Industrial Training took place last week hosted by re.je at UCL Here East 5 - 9 November 2018. The target is to boost participants from industry with little or no ROS knowledge to a level with broad comprehension of the robotic framework.
The theoretical content is consolidated with workshops and is applied on simulated and physical mobile and industrial robots.

Agenda:

* Day 1: Introduction to Linux
* Day 2-4: ROS basic training (introduction, manipulation, navigation)
* Day 5: Advanced ROS topics (statemachine-based programming tools; build, test, release workflow and tools)

The next edition of the training will take place in Q1 2019. Please watch the [re.je](http://re.je/), ROS-Industrial and [ROSIN](http://rosin-project.eu/) websites for more details.

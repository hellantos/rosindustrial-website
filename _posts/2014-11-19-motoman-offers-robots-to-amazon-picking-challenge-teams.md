Yaskawa Motoman Robotics is pleased to announce sponsorship of the [Amazon Picking Challenge](http://amazonpickingchallenge.org/) to be held in conjunction with ICRA 2015. This open competition will further the development of robot skills required for e-commerce and other material handling. Yaskawa Motoman is offering consignment robots to select teams entering the challenge.
Selected teams will receive their choice of robot model in January, 2015 and may keep them through June, subject to model availability. To apply for a Motoman consignment robot, please submit the following items via this [form](http://rosindustrial.org/apc-motoman) by midnight PST December 17, 2014 January 16, 2015 (extended deadline).

* Video of a simulated robot executing a picking task
* Link to your team/organization website
* Completed application describing your Motoman hardware utilization plan

Yaskawa Motoman will provide robots, software (including our MotoROS driver), and onsite technical support both at the team's location and the event.

To support your development efforts, the ROS-Industrial Consortium will be updating its [pick and place tutorial](http://aeswiki.datasys.swri.edu/rositraining/hydro/Exercises/demo/intro) to include the Motoman MH5 II model. The tutorial will also be updated to ROS Indigo. Additional resource links:

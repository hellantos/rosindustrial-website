The Nuclear & Applied Robotics Group ([robotics.me.utexas.edu](http://robotics.me.utexas.edu/)) at the University of Texas at Austin is looking for one outstanding candidate to fill a postdoctoral position in the area of mobile manipulation. The appointment is for one year and renewable yearly by mutual agreement. The candidate must have completed their degree within the last three years and be a US citizen. The start date for the position is ideally September 1, 2014.

The successful candidate will have a PhD with an emphasis on robotics within mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science or a related field. The candidate must be prepared to complete a security background check to work in nuclear and/or government facilities.  

A successful candidate will have completed a dissertation that is topical to mobile manipulation and also must have extensive experience using ROS. U.T. Austin has recently acquired a mobile manipulation system consisting of a Husky mobile platform with two UR5 manipulators. More detail is available on our web site.

The candidate will be expected to take a leadership role in developing new capabilities for the platform relevant to our sponsor as well as coordinate and mentor graduate/undergraduate research associates contributing to the project. Key areas of interest are task planning, navigation, manipulation in the presence of the uncertainty, and sensor (vision, IMU, radiation, etc.) data fusion for visualization and decision making. The candidate will also be expected to help maintain and coordinate collaboratively developed software packages. Candidates will have the opportunity to propose and pursue new and novel avenues for advancing the autonomy or manipulation capabilities for this system.

To apply, email a single file containing your CV and a one page summary of your research interests to[mpryor@utexas.edu](mailto:mpryor@utexas.edu). Please keep the file below 2MB and use the subject line LANL Postdoc Application: Last name, First name. Applications received by June 15, 2014 will receive full consideration and applications will continue to be accepted until the position is filled.

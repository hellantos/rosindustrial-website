We had a successful and productive ROS-Industrial Consortium (RIC) kickoff meeting on March 6thand 7thwith 25 people representing [14 organizations](/ric-kickoff-meeting-attendees) in attendance. We have posted a brief review of the meeting [here](/ric/kickoff). The presentations from the March 6thRIC Open House have been uploaded to our YouTube channel:[ROS-I Consortium](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXyGVRiCwUMc1gav-G7z2ew?feature=mhee). The contents of the March 7thMember's meeting are posted on the [RICmember's portal](http://rosindustrial.org/ric/login), for those who have joined.

You might be wondering what the next Consortium event will be. We are planning a ROS-Industrial training class that will take place at SwRI June 4th-6th. Save the date! It will provide a hands-on introduction to ROS and MoveIt!, and will culminate with hardware integration exercises with live industrial robots and peripherals. It is free for Associate/Full Consortium members (up to three free attendees per organization), and is otherwise $2250/person for non-members or academic/government members. You are welcome to[join](/ric/join)the Consortium at any time, which is a better value if multiple people attend training from the same organization. We will send out a class registration announcement in the next couple weeks.

The ROS Qt Creator Plug-in is developed specifically for ROS to increase a developers' efficiency by simplifying tasks and creating a centralized location for ROS tools. Since it is built on top of the Qt Creator platform, users have access to all of its existing features like: syntax highlighting, editors (C++ , Python, etc.), code completion, version control (Git, Subversion, etc.), debuggers (GDB, CDB, LLDB, etc.), and much more.

The ROS Qt Creator Plug-in provides the following capabilities:

* Import/Create Catkin Workspaces
* Create Catkin Packages
* Custom Build and Run Configuration
	+ catkin\_make (Debug, Release, Release with Debug Info, Minimum Size Release)
	+ roslaunch
	+ rosrun
	+ sourcing workspace  
	Note: The Qt Creator Plug-in supports multiple configurations to enable quick switching between configurations, and everything is saved.
* Integrated Tabbed Terminal
* Templates
	+ Industrial Robot Support Package
	+ Basic Launch File
	+ Basic URDF File
	+ Basic Node File  
	Note: Users may create custom templates.

Check out two videos (below). The first (left) is a short overview of the Qt Creator and its default capabilities. The second video (right) is an overview of the ROS Qt Creator Plug-in developed by Levi Armstrong from Southwest Research Institute. It concludes with an invitation for other to begin using the plug-in for ROS development.

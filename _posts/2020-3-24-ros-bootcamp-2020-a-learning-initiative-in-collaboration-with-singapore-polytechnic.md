This year's edition of the ROS Bootcamp was held from the 16th to 20th March, in collaboration with Singapore Polytechnic. The bootcamp stretched over a 5-day intensive hands-on experience on topics such as perception and autonomous navigation with the turtlebot3.

The students were first introduced to the basics of linux commands and writing a ROS subscriber and publisher. Students were then tasked to write up their own scripts to incorporate the use of open-sourced ROS packages such as AR Tracking & the ROS Navigation Stack. They had also learnt the importance of testing their work in simulation, using powerful tools on ROS such as RViz & Gazebo, before trying the actual hardware.

On the last day of the bootcamp, a mini navigation competition took place to see who's turtlebot would be able to navigate through a maze autonomously using what they have learnt.

The ROS-Industrial team is happy to see a handful of very enthusiastic and strong-willed future engineers growing interest more in the development of robotic applications! We look forward to next year's edition!

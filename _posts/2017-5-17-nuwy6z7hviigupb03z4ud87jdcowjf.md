Thanks to our presenters, Paul Evans (host), Paul Hvass, Matt Robinson, Min Ling Chan, Dave Coleman, and Mirko Bordignon for an informative session on ROS-Industrial projects seeking community involvement. This web meeting, held on 16 May 2017,is the second Global ROS-I Community Web Meeting. Scroll down below the video for abstracts.

* **Paul Evans (ROS-Industrial Americas and SwRI):** Welcome and review of the agenda. The Global Community Web Meeting focused on open source projects seeking broader community participation.
* **Paul Hvass (PlusOne Robotics):** Outgoing ROS-I Americas Program Manager message to the community and introduction of incoming ROS-I Americas Program Manager.
* **Matt Robinson (Transitioning to ROS-Industrial/SwRI):** Incoming ROS-I Americas Program Manager greeting to the community.
* **Min Ling Chan (ROS-Industrial Asia Pacific and A*STAR):** [PackML Business Analytics Dashboard](/s/20170516-ROS-I-Community-Meeting-PackML-Business-Analytics-Dashboard.pdf)
	+ Highlighted a [PackML (Packaging Machine Language) project](http://rosindustrial.org/news/2016/7/29/packml-initiative-for-ros-i) focused on creating an ability to run ROS across multiple OEM PLCs for manufacturing plants for communication between PLCs, increased interoperability, modularity, and efficiency. Proposed is a new Business Analytics Dashboard to provide users an intuitive display of the real-time root cause analysis and OEE.
* **Paul Hvass (PlusOne Robotics):** [Sensor Configuration and Calibration Assistant](/s/20170516-ROS-I-Community-Meeting-Sensor-Configuration-and-Calibration-Setup-Assistant.pdf)
	+ Presented a project to create a graphical user interface for the *[industrial calibration](https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_calibration)* package with preset configurations for the most common calibration cases to simplify the calibration process.
* **Dave Coleman (PickNik):** [MoveIt! Code Sprint â€“ Minimum Cycle Time Motion for Bin Picking](/s/20170516-ROS-I-Community-Meeting-MoveIt-Code-Sprint.pdf)
	+ Introduced the [MoveIt!](http://moveit.ros.org/) Code Sprint focused on integrating existing academic motion planners into MoveIt! that have the potential to improve cycle time, optimize existing planners, and systematically compare performance for industrial use cases.
* **Mirko Bordignon (ROS-Industrial Europe and Fraunhofer IPA):** [The ROSIN Project](/s/20170516-ROS-I-Community-Meeting-ROSin.pdf)
	+ Provided an overview of the new [ROSIN](http://www.rosin-project.eu/) European initiative. ROSIN was launched to bring ROS to the factory floor with a focus on improving software quality. Included is a targeted investment for ROS-Industrial Focused Technical Projects. Educational activities are included as a key component of the initiative to support wider adoption.

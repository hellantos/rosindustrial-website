The ROS-Industrial Consortium is tackling a topic that is of interest to the whole ROS community: conversion of CAD data to ROS-interpretable file types (e.g. URDF, SRDF). This work will be conducted over the next three years by the [TU Delft Robotics Institute](http://robotics.tudelft.nl/). To help us make ROS even more convenient to use:

* [Click to read a public version of the CAD to ROS FTP proposal.](/s/FTP-Proposal-CAD-ROS-Public-Rev2.pdf)
* Submit a letter of intent to participate by the end of July. UPDATE: Now due Aug. 7.
* Participants must be current ROS-I Consortium members. [Join now!](http://rosindustrial.org/ric-americas/join-now/)
* A full proposal is available upon request: [paul.hvass@swri.org](mailto:paul.hvass@swri.org?Subject=Interest%20in%20CAD%20to%20ROS%20FTP).

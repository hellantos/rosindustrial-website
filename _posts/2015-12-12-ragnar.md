ROS-Industrial software developers at Southwest Research Institute have collaborated with the product development team at [Blue WorkForce](http://blueworkforce.com/) to create a ROS package for their [Ragnar](http://blueworkforce.com/ragnar/) robot. The Ragnar is a 4-legged delta style robot designed to be affordable and reconfigurable for a variety of work volumes and tasks. Special thanks to:

* **ROS-I Team:** Jonathan Meyer, Alex Goins, and Jeremy Zoss
* **Blue WorkForce Team:** Michael Frederiksen and Preben Hj√∏rnet

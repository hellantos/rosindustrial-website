The ROS-Industrial Consortium Americas hosted a ROS-Industrial Developers Training Class June 6-8, 2017, at SwRI in San Antonio, Texas. Twelve attendees represented a diverse set of organizations, including Bastian Solutions, EWI, John Deere, PlusOne Robotics, Magna International, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, The University of Texas at Austin, and Yaskawa America's Motoman Robotics Division. The three-day class was geared toward individuals with a C++ programming background who sought to learn to compose their own ROS nodes.

* Day 1 focused on introductory ROS skills.
* Day 2 examined motion planning using MoveIt! as well as using the Descartes planner and perception concepts.
* Day 3 included an introduction to perception and culminated with lab programming exercises with a choice of Pick-and-Place Application or Descartes Application.

Many thanks to training class leaders Jeremy Zoss and Austin Deric. The training curriculum is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_training/wiki).

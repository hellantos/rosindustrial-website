This is the first installment in a series of updates and strategic initiatives
by the various ROS-Industrial Consortia. Though these may appear to be regional
differences, the aim is still to leverage ROS-Industrial global support to
realize improved capability and performance of ROS-Indsutrial applications and
tools. In the near term, based on complimentary initaitives, such as the ARM
Institute in the United States, and ROSIN in the EU, some variation by region
may emerge to enable efficient leverage of these initiatives and reduce any
redundancy in effort.

**Part 1, Updates and New Strategic Initiatives for the ROS-Industrial
Consortium Americas**

Recently ROS-Industrial Consortium Americas Leadership, along with review, and
consultation, with the global ROS-Industrial leadership, presented to the
Americas Consortium Advisory Council a number of proposed changes to the
agreement, and for feedback on proposed strategic initiatives.

The most interesting and meaningful changes are:

1. **Start-Up Classification** - Start-ups have expressed interest in joining
the Consortium, but see the current classifications as prohibitive due to
cost. The benefits will be the same as associate. This reduced rate for
start-ups is to enable greater start-up community engagement with the
Consortium and to ensure their voices are represented in the technical and
strategic roadmaps. The rate will be \$2500/Year, and will be limited to
four years of age of company and 40 technical staff in size.
2. **In-Kind Contributions** - Clarification on In-kind contributions related
to FTP projects; Specify upfront during proposal development in-kind
contributions as deliverables by team members, and leave out of formal
proposal as costed tasks to be completed. The contribution becomes a
deliverable by that team. No cost is included in any of the costing/dollars
associated. All parties accept what is considered in-kind and ROS-I
Technical personnel will be responsible for the assessment of the
contribution related to meeting the deliverable, i.e. realizing the value.

In-kind in hardware can be accepted if it is relevant to the scope of work
as stated in the Proposal and all participants agree in accepting the
in-kind contribution towards that team's cost share.

At this time, there will be NO in-kind toward dues.
3. **Training Tuition Applied Toward Dues** - Codify in the agreement language
to allow entities to apply training tuition toward dues membership. This is
advantageous for universities in particular that have challenges spending
funds on consortia.
4. **Positions within the ROS-Industrial Organization** - To improve
opportunities and to encourage ROS-I specific community/University
development, it is proposed to offer and support "Positions" within the
ROS-I organization. These would be unpaid positions, but would be
represented in the ROS-I organizational structure, have roles and
responsibilities, and a mutually agreed upon term of engagement, i.e. one
Consortium, Calendar, or Academic Year.

The benefit to the position holder is this can be included on a resume and
letters of reference/recommendations can be provided by those that realized
the benefits of the contributions and/or support. Ideally, members would be
open to "sponsoring" the position, and a representative that benefitted from
the work would be willing to author letters of reference for the position
holder. Sponsor would acknowledge that the maintainer/community member is
making improvements to a package/capability/driver under advice and/or
direction of the sponsor. The benefit for the community member, or position
holder, is that this time within the position is something can be later
included on a resume and letters of reference from those that benefitted
from the work could be forthcoming. The intent is to drive improved
engagement from academia and the broader community and enables higher level
of ROS-I/Industry specific development and contribution to the code base.
5. **Extraction of Robot Drivers and Recognition of Supporting Organizations**
– Moving forward OEM-centric packages will have their Drivers moved to a
separate location to enable focused adoption by OEMs.

A number of these drivers and interfaces are currently not supported,
formally, by the ROS-I leadership or Consortia, and are typically pulled in
and modified by discrete users for their specific use cases. This just makes
it clear of the status and drives the conversation to the OEMs. If/When OEMs
decide to take ownership of their interfaces, they are in one common place
where only the relevant interface is located and complimentary packages,
that are not related specifically to the interface are not impacted. The
intent is to drive awareness of the support status and highlight those
OEMs/partners that step in to support/improve their drivers.
6. **ROS 2 Training Module** - As ROS 2 becomes more mature and sunsetting of
ROS 1 commences, it has become clear that training may need to be updated to
reflect the latest around ROS 2 development. Current proposal is to create a
ROS 2 module and offer this as an "Advanced Topic", much like current
training programs do for Perception Pipeline, and other more in-depth
topics. We look forward to collaboration with the ROSIN initiative to assist
in ROS 2 training content development.
7. **Certificates for Training Completion** - At this time there is no formal
"Certificate" for training completion. In certain cases these have been
requested and created. The CAC voted to maintain the default as no
certificate for training completion, but they can be *provided upon
reques*t. A template is available, and has been utilized on request. Thank
you to ROS-Industrial Consortium – Asia-Pacific for the creation of the
certificate.
8. **Problem-Centric Roadmap Creation** - It has been customary for the ROS-I
Consortium Americas to revisit and have roadmapping exercises at the Annual
Meeting in the Spring. In 2017 a number of interviews were conducted by
ROS-I Americas leadership discussing manufacturing problem-centric
roadmapping model. [Current technical vision
graphic](https://rosindustrial.org/news/2017/3/14/road-map-for-ros-industrial)
contains "elements" that need development around capabilities that combined
in certain ways can address problems, however the problem-centric
prioritization provides additional context to this technical capability
view. This priority of problems would lead to FTP concepts that then could
be championed or voted up/down based on member interest.

The first workshop to generate a Problem-Centric Roadmap will be held the
afternoon of March 8th amongst the Consortium-Americas membership. The
result will be summarized and reported in a Blog Post following the 2018
Annual Meeting.

We hope that everyone finds these changes and new initiatives value-added to the overall objective of ROS-Industrial. We anticipate the changes will foster and grow the community and broaden OEM and solution provider engagement.

Furthermore, engagement and alignment with complimenting organizations/initiatives such as the [ARM Institute](http://www.arminstitute.org/) in the United States, and [ROSIN](http://rosin-project.eu/) in the European Union, are critical as well, and enable a more efficient leverage of the three Consortia and broader ROS-Industrial resources.

We look forward to rolling out these various initiatives and hope the community and our membership find them delivering value and enabling the realization of the ROS-Industrial vision.

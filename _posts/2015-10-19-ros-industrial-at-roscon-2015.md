The ROS-Industrial Initiative had a strong presence at the last edition of ROSCon, the ROS developers' conference, which was held on October 3-4 in Hamburg, Germany, right after IROS. This ROSCon, the fourth since the inaugural edition in 2012, was particularly significant as the available registration slots sold out weeks before the event. The organizers, the [OSRF](http://www.osrfoundation.org/), managed to fit more than 350 people at the conference venue, which spread over two buildings at the University of Hamburg, right in the heart of the city.

Not only was attendance a record high, but a quick "raise your hands" poll among the participants showed that the overwhelming majority was attending ROScon for the first time. This is a clear sign that ROS is quickly raising interest outside its original development community, which confirms our strong belief that it can be of great value for the broader robotics and automation world. The [scheduled](http://roscon.ros.org/2015/#program) and lightning talks showcased a great variety of use cases and technical developments, such as autonomous driving as well as automated warehouses. ROS-Industrial was represented with members from both the Consortia attending and delivering talks, in addition to providing information about the initiative to conference participants visiting our booth at the exhibitor area.

During the second birds-of-a-feather session the 5th ROS-Industrial community meeting was held, during which we discussed driver development, the upcoming FTPs, and the details on how to join the online developers meeting. We would like to thank all participants for contributing to an interesting discussion!

This was probably the ROSCon edition marking the de facto acceptance of ROS as the robotics software "tool of choice" for practitioners in academia and industry. It was very interesting to discuss with participants how the robotics landscape is evolving, and rest assured that we at ROS-Industrial are closely following such developments: please refer to our upcoming events [schedule](http://rosindustrial.org/news/2015/10/10/upcoming-ros-i-events) to see for yourself what an exciting year lies ahead.

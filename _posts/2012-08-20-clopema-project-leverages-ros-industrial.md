![Two MA1400's used in CloPeMa program for manipulation of clothing.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m918wdly6r1rppbyq.jpg)[CloPeMa](http://clopema.iti.gr/index.html), Clothes Perception and Manipulation, is a European project to research the manipulation of clothing and other textiles with industrial robots. The ultimate vision of the program is to autonomously fold "any" kind of clothing. The grasping and manipulation of flexible objects is a non-trivial problem. This makes the CloPeMa very exciting. The research will definitely push the state of the art in robotic grasping and manipulation. 

Five partners are working together on this program:

* [Czech Technical University (CVUT), Czech, Republic](http://www.cvut.cz/)is performing industrial robot integration and depth data analysis
* [University of Glasgow (UG), United Kingdom](http://www.gla.ac.uk/)is developing the 3D vision hardware.
* [Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), Greece](http://www.iti.gr/) is performing project management and developing intelligent planning of actions software.
* [Neovision s.r.o. (NEO), NEO, Czech Republic)](http://www.neovision.cz/) is performing system integration.
* [University of Genova (UNIGE), Italy](http://www.unige.it/) developing a state of the artl gripper with tactile and optic sensing.

CTU is utilizing [ROS-Industrial](http://rosindustrial.org/)to control two Motoman,[MA1400](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CEUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.motoman.com%2Fdatasheets%2FMA1400.pdf&ei=6R0fUPKpGKOo2wWc4oDoBw&usg=AFQjCNHaRQCkSIiVwsWd69fE0jlUR8Zmkw&sig2=INNAFSDDF5eCxP4zzXGbxA)industrial robots. They are expanding the capability in the[Motoman stack](http://ros.org/wiki/motoman)to enable multi-robot control. New capabilities will include the ability two move multiple manipulators at the same time. The software developed under the CloPeMa project will be released open source.

On April 7, the ROS-Industrial Consortium Americas hosted its annual meeting in Chicago following on the heels of the Automate show. The meeting brought together more than 60 people from across the industrial robotics industry to learn about, discuss, and plan for the future of open source software for manufacturing automation. The Consortium is now a world-wide organization led by SwRI in the Americas, Fraunhofer IPA in Europe, and A*STAR ARTC in the Asia Pacific region.

The annual meeting demarked a number of milestones for ROS-I:

* The [open source software repository](https://github.com/ros-industrial) celebrated its 5th anniversary
* The Consortium celebrated its 4th year
* The Consortium is expanding to the Asia Pacific region with the [RIC-AP Workshop](/events/2017/5/25/ric-ap-workshop) occurring in May
* Global membership reached [50 members](/ric/current-members/)!

One of the chief benefits of the Consortium is the ability of members to sponsor Focused Technical Projects. These projects expand the capabilities of ROS-I and costs are shared by participating members so their resources are multiplied by their collaborators. This year, five project topics were announced and then discussed in a round table forum:

* Collaborative Robotic Fastener Installation
* Sensor Configuration and Calibration Assistant
* MoveIt! Code Sprint
* ROS-I Business Analytics Dashboard
* Robotic Edge Processing

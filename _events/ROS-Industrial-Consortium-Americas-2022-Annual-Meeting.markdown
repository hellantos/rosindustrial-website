The ROS-Industrial Consortium Americas will host its annual meeting in conjunction with the Automate 2022 show in Detroit. The annual Members' Meeting is a chance to understand the latest developments relative to ROS-Industrial, both within the Americas and around the world. There will be a chance to engage on the strategy for how ROS-I capability is shaped, in particular wiht atest developments around ROS2, and how we navigate the migration and leverage of ROS2.

This is always a great opportunity to engage with other interested end-users, OEMs, solution providers and researchers on open source, interoperable, agile software capabilities. The collaborations that emerge through these interactions have led to significant accomplishments, of which you will learn about at this gathering. We look forward to seeing everyone in Chicago!

    <p class="text-align-justify">Create an open community and common software repository where researchers,
    robotics professionals, and industrial controls experts can contribute robust and
    reliable manufacturing related ROS software, combining the relative strengths
    of ROS and existing technologies (i.e. combining ROS high level functionality with
    the low level reliability and safety of robot controllers). </p>


    <p>Over time ROS Industrial will be positioned to become the leader, and
    standard, in advanced robotics software by presenting a new way to solve complex
    challenges through the democratization of tools and capabilities, thus driving end user
    value through new capability leverage, and solution provider value by focusing on the
    new capability creation versus recreation of interfaces and building blocks.</p>

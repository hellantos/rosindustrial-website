Create an open community and common software repository where researchers,
robotics professionals, and industrial controls experts can contribute robust and
reliable manufacturing related ROS software, combining the relative strengths
of ROS and existing technologies (i.e. combining ROS high level functionality with
the low level reliability and safety of robot controllers). 

Over time ROS Industrial will be positioned to become the leader, and
standard, in advanced robotics software by presenting a new way to solve complex
challenges through the democratization of tools and capabilities, thus driving end user
value through new capability leverage, and solution provider value by focusing on the
new capability creation versus recreation of interfaces and building blocks.
